# AI Coaching Actions Flow (Steps 4–5)

Status: Draft

## Goal
Define action generation, corrections, and rejection handling for Steps 4–5.

## Step 4: Action Drafts
- For each sub-goal: generate base/min/challenge actions.
- Mark base as active by default.
- Provide action expansion entry (add-action UI).

## Step 5: Reality Check
- Apply correction rules (frequency, duration, vague wording, etc.).
- Present adjustments with warm tone.
- Allow accept or keep original (rejection flow).

## Rejection Flow
- If user keeps original, store minimum fallback.

## Notes
- Action type/frequency auto-setting must run before Step 7 save.
