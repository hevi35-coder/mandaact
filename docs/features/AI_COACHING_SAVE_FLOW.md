# AI Coaching Save Flow (Steps 6–7)

Status: Draft

## Goal
Define routine scheduling, pre-save validation, and final save UX.

## Step 6: Routine Setup
- UI: weekly routine picker for active actions.
- Suggest schedule based on energy peak + availability.
- Provide “minimum today” fallback reminder.

## Step 7: Final Review & Save
- Show summary card (core goal, sub-goals, active actions).
- Run pre-save validation (type/frequency configured).
- If missing: show warning with auto-set + manual edit.

## Save Rules
- Save only when all actions are configured.
- Persist active actions and variants.

## Notes
- Uses pre-save review UX from milestone Section 7.2.3.
