# AI Coaching Step Navigation & Resume (Draft)

Status: Draft

## Goal
Define how users move between steps and resume sessions.

## Navigation Rules
- Next step unlocks when all required inputs are saved.
- Users can pause anytime; session remains active.
- Step order is fixed (1–7).

## Resume Card
- Show on Home if session status is active.
- Display: current step, last summary, next prompt preview.
- CTA: “Continue”.

## Recap Screen
- If last_resumed_at > 7 days, show recap before resuming.
- Recap includes: core goal + latest active actions.

## Notes
- Resume is step-based, not day-based.
