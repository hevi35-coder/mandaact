# 🗣️ Feedback Collection & Management Guide

During the community launch (Week 2), actively listening to users is more important than talking.

## 1. Primary Channels (Where to look)

### 🔹 Disquiet (디스콰이엇)
*   **Action**: Reply to *every* comment on your Maker Log.
*   **Goal**: Create a conversation, not just a broadcast. Ask questions back (e.g., "Which feature do you think is missing?").

### 🔹 App Store Connect
*   **Action**: Check "Ratings and Reviews" daily.
*   **Goal**: Reply to all reviews within 24 hours.
    *   **5-star**: Thank them and ask what they like most.
    *   **1-3 star**: Apologize for the inconvenience and ask for specific details to fix it (e.g., "Could you email us at support@unwrittenbd.com?").

### 🔹 Direct Email (support@unwrittenbd.com)
*   **Action**: Monitor this inbox.
*   **Goal**: Treat these as "High Validated Leads". These users took the time to email you.

## 2. Feedback Categorization (How to organize)

When you receive feedback, categorize it into 3 buckets:

1.  **🐛 Bug Report** (Critical)
    *   "Login failed", "App crashed", "OCR didn't work"
    *   **Action**: Fix immediately.

2.  **✨ Feature Request** (Nice to have)
    *   "iPad support needed", "Dark mode please", "Widget?"
    *   **Action**: Add to `ROADMAP.md` but don't promise immediate delivery.

3.  **❤️ Love/Praise** (Marketing Asset)
    *   "Finally found the app I needed"
    *   **Action**: Screenshot it (anonymized) and use it for Week 3 content.

## 3. Simple Survey (Optional)

If you want structured data, you can create a simple Google Form or Tally form with these 3 questions:
1.  **How did you find MandaAct?** (Channel check)
2.  **What is the one thing you want to achieve with this app?** (Value prop check)
3.  **What is stopping you from using it more?** (Friction check)
