# 📝 Medium Blog Launch Guide

Follow this guide to set up your "MandaAct" presence on Medium effectively for both Global and Korean audiences.

## 1. Account & Profile Setup
*   **Sign Up**: Go to [Medium.com](https://medium.com) and sign up with your company email (`support@unwrittenbd.com` or founder's email).
*   **Name**: Use **"MandaAct Team"** or **"Founder Name @ MandaAct"**.
*   **Bio**: "Turning 9x9 Mandalart goals into daily GTD actions. 🇰🇷 & 🇺🇸"
*   **Photo**: Use the MandaAct App Icon.

## 2. Create a "Publication" (Crucial)
Instead of just posting as a person, create a **Publication**. This acts like your "Company Blog" page.
1.  Click your profile icon -> **Manage Publications** -> **New Publication**.
2.  **Name**: `MandaAct Blog` (or `The Act of Doing`).
3.  **Tagline**: *From Goal to Action.*
4.  **Tags**: `Productivity`, `Startup`, `Life Hacking`, `Apps`.

## 3. The "Hybrid" Posting Strategy (First Post)
To target both markets without confusing the algorithm, we will post the **English version as the main story** and link the Korean version (or put it in the same post).

### Recommended Pattern: "The Dual-Link"
Write two separate posts, but cross-link them at the very top.

*   **Global Post (Main)**:
    *   Title: *Why 99% of Mandalarts Fail (And How to Fix It)*
    *   Top Line: *"🇰🇷 한국어 버전은 [여기]에서 읽을 수 있습니다."* (Link to KR post)
*   **Korean Post (Sub)**:
    *   Title: *오타니의 만다라트, 왜 우리는 항상 실패할까요?*
    *   Top Line: *"🇺🇸 Read the English version [here]."* (Link to EN post)

## 4. Promotion (After Publishing)
1.  **Linked In**: Share the Medium link.
2.  **Reddit**: Share the Medium link in `r/productivity` (add value in comments).
3.  **Disquiet**: Post the Korean link.
