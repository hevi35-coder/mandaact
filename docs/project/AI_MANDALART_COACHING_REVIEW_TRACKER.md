Last updated: 2025-12-25

## Purpose
Track improvements against the milestone UX expectations while iterating the 7-step AI coaching flow.

---

## 1) Priority 1 (Must Fix)
- [x] Step 1: Reduce question count per persona; add "More questions" expand toggle.
- [x] Step 2: Add SMART guidance + example (good/bad) below core goal input.
- [x] Step 4: Add per-sub-goal collapse/expand to reduce scroll fatigue.
- [x] Step 5: Show rationale for realism corrections (why suggestion was made).
- [x] Step 6: Allow custom routine selection (weekdays or count-per-week).
- [x] Step 7: Show type/frequency summary on final review cards.

---

## 2) Priority 2 (Should Improve)
- [x] Step 3: Allow partial sub-goal completion (4–6 now, expand later).
- [x] Step 4: Explain base/min/challenge selection criteria.
- [x] Step 5: Strengthen rejection flow (store minimum fallback + explain next step).
- [x] Step 7: Explain Plan/Minimum toggle availability in final review (tooltip or CTA).
- [x] Global: Update UI copy to match warm coach tone.

---

## 3) Later (Nice to Have)
- [x] Add step-by-step summary/history for long sessions.
- [x] Improve gate→coaching transition copy (limit/ads rationale).
- [x] Add persona-specific recommendation snippets per step.
